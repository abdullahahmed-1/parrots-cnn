# Bird Species Prediction System

This project contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify bird species and a Streamlit web interface to demonstrate the predictions.

## Project Structure

- `bird_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for training the model (optimized for Google Colab).
- `app.py`: Streamlit web application for the inference interface.
- `bird_model.h5`: The trained model file (generated by the notebook).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Windows users: Enable Long Paths (Required for Tensorflow dependencies).
    - Run this in PowerShell as Administrator if you encounter installation errors:
      ```powershell
      New-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem' -Name 'LongPathsEnabled' -Value 1 -PropertyType DWORD -Force
      ```

## Installation

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

1.  **Create a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

2.  **Activate the virtual environment**:
    - Windows:
      ```bash
      .\venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - Mac/Linux:
      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit tensorflow pillow numpy
    ```

## Usage

### 1. Training the Model
1.  Upload `bird_prediction.ipynb` to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).
2.  Upload your dataset folder (`Birds dataset.jpg`) to your Google Drive.
3.  Mount Drive in Colab and run all cells.
4.  Download the generated `bird_model.h5` file and place it in this project directory.

### 2. Running the App
Ensure `bird_model.h5` is in the same directory as `app.py`.

Run the application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
(If using the virtual environment, ensure it is activated or use `.\venv\Scripts\streamlit run app.py`)

## Troubleshooting

- **ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'**: Ensure you have activated your virtual environment before running the app.
- **OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory...**: This is likely the Windows Long Path issue. See the Prerequisites section.
